# Explorea

Exploration Made Easy. Think-Click-Fly that simple to explore the world. Explorea is a web application that allows users to explore the world through our trekking events. Users can book prior slots for upcoming tekking events that we regularly host. Users can also search for a location and get information about that location. This is a static page site that gives a glimpse of how a camping site looks like.
